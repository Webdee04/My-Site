      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I'm a sincere student, who goes to college regularly but rarely attend any lecture. I like to play games, code and watch some really cool anime shows. Currently learning Web Development and want to get my hands over it to create beautiful and attractive websites.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I'm actually a beginner but soon coding will be the most honed skill of mine. Right now I am learning Web Development which include technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Bootstrap and many more.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>Though coding is a skill that I want to focus on, but gaming is the best weapon in my arsenal. Especially in BGMI, It would be a very tough time for you if you want to defeat me. Well, I have played some other games also like God Of War, Minecraft, Counter Strike and some super nostalgic as well as classical games like Mario, Contra and Pokemon GBA games too.</p>
